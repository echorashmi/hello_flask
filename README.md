To work on local: 
1. Open project folder hello_flask on local IDE 
2. Open terminal and navigate to /path/hello_flask
3. In terminal, type "flask run", that will load up a virtual server environment
4. Then you can navigate to http://localhost:[port-number]
5. Continue to edit on the local IDE 
6. Use Terminal for Debugging
7. That's all!

Known Issues:
1. I haven't been able to use the terminal inside my IDE for flask run, it doesn't work and doesn't initialise the Virtual Env. Not sure why that is. I have a workaround that works for me and allows me to focus on the application itself. I am curious about this and might come back to fix it and get my IDE to run "flask run" at some point.
